## About
I started this repository mainly because the Stream Deck software currently doesn't have a "background colour" setting. You can style the text titles of your Stream Deck buttons any way you want, but only on whatever icon is set, either custom or those blue-ish default Elgato icons. You currently can't give the buttons a simple solid background colour, why ever that is.

There's also no way to make the background of a button completely black/transparent. Just deleting a button's icon graphic will make the button revert to a default blue-ish icon provided by Elgato.

In other words: for anything that involves a background colour, however trivial it may be, you need to create your own custom Stream Deck icons.

So that's what I did.

The first 3 icon packs (Simple Bright Colours, Simple Dark Colours, Simple Gray Tones) are essentially collections of primitive colours and tones. The Simple Bright Colours are more vivid and eye-catching, the Simple Dark Colours are more dim and laid-back, and the Simple Gray Tones is just black and white icon backgrounds, as well as three intermediate gray tones.

It's nothing revolutionary or ground-breaking, but for me and customizing my Stream Deck, these coloured icon backgrounds have been absolutely essential. If you can put them to use as well - good for the both of us. :)

## Support
I started creating these icon packs for my own use, out of necessity. These are not meant to be commercial products, "I am not a company", I don't make any money off their creation, distribution or maintenance.

But if you find any bugs, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to report them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rcliftonharvey/stream-deck-icons/issues), I may have a look there every now and then.

Enjoy!
